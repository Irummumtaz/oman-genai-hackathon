# TODO: Define three tasks for the HR recruitment system
#
# Each task needs:
#   - description: Step-by-step instructions for the agent
#   - expected_output: What the agent should return
#   - agent: Which agent performs this task
#
# Use placeholders: {pdf_files_path}, {txt_files_path},
#                   {json_files_path}, {matches_output_path}
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------

    Read all PDF resumes from the directory at {pdf_files_path}.  
    Extract key information such as personal details, skills, work experience,

    each containing extracted details from the corresponding resume.

cv_analyzer_task:
  description: >
    Analyze all structured TXT files located at {txt_files_path}.  
    Convert the content into structured JSON by identifying skills,
    experience relevance, seniority, strengths, weaknesses, and job readiness.
    Create one JSON file per candidate and save them to {json_files_path}.

    complete structured candidate profile with skills, experience summary,
    strengths, and suitability annotations.

  agent: cv_analyzer


job_matching_task:
  description: >
    Compare all candidate JSON profiles from {json_files_path} against the
    job descriptions provided. Evaluate skill match percentage, experience
    alignment, and overall suitability. Generate ranked job-candidate matches
    and save the results in {matches_output_path} as a consolidated report.

  expected_output: >
    A detailed matching report saved in {matches_output_path} containing
    ranked candidates for each job, along with match scores and explanations.
